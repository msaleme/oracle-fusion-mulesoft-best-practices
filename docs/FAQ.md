## Authentication & Security

### Q: How do I obtain OAuth credentials for Oracle Fusion?
**A:** Follow these steps:
1. Log into Oracle Fusion with administrator privileges
2. Navigate to Security Console > API Platform
3. Create a new OAuth client application
4. Select appropriate scopes based on your integration needs
5. Save the Client ID and Client Secret securely

### Q: What's the difference between Basic Auth and OAuth?
**A:** 
- **Basic Auth**: Simple but less secure, uses username/password
- **OAuth 2.0**: More secure, uses token-based authentication with expiry
- Oracle recommends OAuth 2.0 for production environments

### Q: How should I store sensitive credentials?
**A:** 
- Use MuleSoft's Secure Properties feature
- Store in external vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never commit credentials to source control
- Use environment-specific secure property files

## Performance & Optimization

### Q: How can I improve API response times?
**A:** Several strategies:
1. **Caching**: Use Object Store for frequently accessed data
2. **Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate pool sizes
3. **Batch Processing**: Use bulk APIs for large data sets
4. **Streaming**: Enable response streaming for large payloads
5. **Pagination**: Implement proper pagination for list operations

### Q: What are the Oracle Fusion API rate limits?
**A:** Rate limits vary by:
- API endpoint
- License type
- Environment (production vs sandbox)

Typical limits:
- 500 requests per minute for most endpoints
- 50 concurrent connections
- Check Oracle documentation for specific limits

### Q: How should I handle large data extracts?
**A:** 
1. Use Oracle's BI Publisher for scheduled reports
2. Implement pagination with offset/limit
3. Use streaming instead of loading entire payload
4. Consider async processing with queues
5. Schedule extracts during off-peak hours

## Error Handling

### Q: What are common Oracle Fusion API errors?
**A:** 
- **401 Unauthorized**: Token expired or invalid credentials
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid endpoint or resource
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Oracle Fusion issue
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Maintenance or overload

### Q: How should I implement retry logic?
**A:** 
```xml
<until-successful maxRetries="3" millisBetweenRetries="5000">
    <!-- Retry on 503, 429, and network errors -->
    <!-- Don't retry on 400, 401, 403, 404 -->
</until-successful>
```

### Q: What should I log for troubleshooting?
**A:** Essential information:
- Correlation ID
- Request/Response timestamps
- HTTP status codes
- Error messages
- Payload size
- User/System context

## Integration Patterns

### Q: When should I use synchronous vs asynchronous integration?
**A:** 
**Synchronous**: 
- Real-time data needs
- Small payload sizes
- User-initiated requests
- Quick operations (< 30 seconds)

**Asynchronous**:
- Batch processing
- Large data volumes
- Long-running operations
- Non-critical timing

### Q: How do I handle Oracle Fusion's complex data structures?
**A:** 
1. Use DataWeave for transformations
2. Create reusable transformation modules
3. Handle optional fields with defaults
4. Validate data before sending to Oracle
5. Map Oracle's nested structures carefully

## Deployment & Operations

### Q: What environments should I set up?
**A:** Recommended:
1. **Development**: Connected to Oracle Sandbox
2. **Test**: For integration testing
3. **UAT**: User acceptance with Oracle Test
4. **Production**: Connected to Oracle Production

### Q: How do I monitor integrations in production?
**A:** 
1. Use Anypoint Monitoring
2. Set up alerts for errors and performance
3. Implement health check endpoints
4. Log to centralized system (ELK, Splunk)
5. Track business metrics

### Q: What should be included in CI/CD pipeline?
**A:** 
- Automated unit tests (MUnit)
- Integration tests
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Automated deployment
- Smoke tests post-deployment

## Common Issues

### Q: Why am I getting "Invalid Cross-Reference" errors?
**A:** This occurs when:
- Referenced ID doesn't exist in Oracle
- ID is from wrong business unit
- Data synchronization issues

Solution: Validate IDs before use, implement lookup caching

### Q: How do I handle Oracle Fusion maintenance windows?
**A:** 
1. Subscribe to Oracle maintenance notifications
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern
3. Queue requests during maintenance
4. Have fallback mechanisms
5. Communicate downtime to users

### Q: What causes "Partial Success" in bulk operations?
**A:** Common causes:
- Validation errors on some records
- Constraint violations
- Permission issues for specific data
- Data format inconsistencies

Handle by processing results individually and logging failures

## Best Practices Summary

### Q: What are the top 5 best practices?
**A:** 
1. **Always use OAuth 2.0** for production
2. **Implement comprehensive error handling**
3. **Cache frequently accessed reference data**
4. **Use bulk APIs for large operations**
5. **Monitor performance and set up alerts**

### Q: Where can I find more help?
**A:** 
- Oracle Fusion REST API Documentation
- MuleSoft Forum and Community
- Oracle Support Portal
- This repository's Issues section
- MuleSoft Support (for licensed users)

## Version-Specific Questions

### Q: Are there differences between Oracle Fusion versions?
**A:** Yes, key differences:
- API endpoints may change
- New features added regularly
- Authentication methods evolved
- Always check Oracle's release notes

### Q: How do I handle API version deprecation?
**A:** 
1. Monitor Oracle's deprecation notices
2. Use version-specific endpoints
3. Plan migration before deprecation
4. Test thoroughly with new versions
5. Maintain backward compatibility
